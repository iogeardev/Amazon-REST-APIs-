# Seller / Inventory

**Purpose:** Reference for FBA inventory summaries and inventory snapshots.

## Primary outputs (recommended)
- Raw: `exports/raw/seller/...`
- Modeled: `exports/modeled/seller/...`

## Notes
- Replace stub JSON with real SP-API response snapshots (sanitized).
- Keep column naming consistent with `powerbi/schema/*.schema.json`.
