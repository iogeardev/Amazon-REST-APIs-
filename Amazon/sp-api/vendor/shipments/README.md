# Vendor / Shipments

**Purpose:** Reference for Vendor shipment confirmations and shipped quantities.

## Primary outputs (recommended)
- Raw: `exports/raw/vendor/...`
- Modeled: `exports/modeled/vendor/...`

## Notes
- Replace stub JSON with real SP-API response snapshots (sanitized).
- Keep column naming consistent with `powerbi/schema/*.schema.json`.
